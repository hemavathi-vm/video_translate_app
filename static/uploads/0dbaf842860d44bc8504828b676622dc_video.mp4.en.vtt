WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
all the three IP by NB files.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.560
You're free to collaborate with your classmates,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.720
but just write the name of

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.240
the people you collaborated with at the top of the worksheet.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.440
So I'll just introduce the worksheets to you guys.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.020
So worksheet two is on simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.240
You'll have to just plot a scatter plot and build a linear regression model.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.520
You have to check if it follows the OLS assumptions

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.120
and validate the linear regression model.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.400
Then the multiple linear regression,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.920
you have to plot a correlogram and check

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.520
which contributes most to the target variable

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.680
and build a multiple linear regression model based on that.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.440
Worksheet 2B is based on ridge regression,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.000
lasso and elastic regression.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.160
You'll have to build all these three models.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.840
Worksheet 2C is on logistic regression.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.040
You'll have to just build a logistic regression model

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.880
and plot the ROC curve and AAC value.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.360
So the last day to submit will be 20th September.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.160
Before constructing the correlogram,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.160
you can use anything label encoding or one or 10 coding.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.360
Just convert.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.320
You can ask your doubts in the chat

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.880
or you can raise your hand, we'll unmute you.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.320
There will be another TA session four or five days before the deadline.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.760
So by then your portion should be covered,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.520
so you'll be able to solve and ask more questions that time.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.880
But if you have any doubts, you can put it in the chat or unmute

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.240
or raise your hand, we'll unmute.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.320
You can just use the libraries to build the model.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.560
Like for linear regression model, you can use LM

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560
and for worksheet 2B, you can use GLM net.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.560
You need not build one from SCAD, just import the libraries.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.920
You can use any library you want.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.680
There is no completion on the syntax.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.920
You can use any syntax or any libraries you want.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.920
Which question three? The OLS assumptions?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.920
Yeah, for OLS assumptions, you can do like three.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.920
You can check if the residuals follow the normal distribution.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.920
You can check for homosodacity and you can check for the linear relationship.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.920
You can do three, that's enough.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920
Does that answer your question?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.920
Yeah, if you put it as a markdown, it will be better and professional.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.920
If it's a code, then use the code.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.920
Both graphs and write-ups,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.920
because try to add your analysis as much as possible, not only code.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.920
So add comments or a markdown for whatever you are plotting.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.920
Vignesh, you can unmute and ask the question.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920
Yes?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.920
In one sheet, we have prepositions, right?

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.920
You need to answer in experiment or what?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.920
Yeah, that's what I answered.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.920
You can add a markdown cell and answer in that cell after each question.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.920
Does that answer your question?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.920
Yeah, Rohan, the histogram of residuals is enough for normal distribution.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.920
But do add like a text cell scene.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.920
Just don't add the code guys.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.920
Just don't write the code for plotting histogram and leave it like this.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.920
Do add an analysis of the graph.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.920
Yeah, markdown code, markdown code.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.920
Just add markdown cells whenever you want to write the text or analysis

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.920
and code cells when you want to execute the code.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.920
Are there any more questions or we shall end the meet?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.920
There will be another TA session four or five days before the deadline.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.920
So you guys should, the portion should be covered by then.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.920
So you guys should be able to solve that.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.920
About the hackathon, we'll let you know soon.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.920
Do you guys have any more questions?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.920
Okay, then we'll end the meet.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.920
Thank you for joining us.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.920
If any of you have missed the first part of this session,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.920
we'll make the recording available.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920
You guys can catch up with that.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920
Thank you.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.920
Thank you.
